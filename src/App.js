// Restrictions: Do not use a CSS framework. Write CSS from scratch. You may, however, use a CSS reset of your choice (not compulsory).

// We are looking for
// - How you structure your HTML
// - The class names you create & use
// - Coding style (indents)
// - Decisions you take after seeing the layout
// - Any specific decisions you take if you foresee an issue.
// - Assume you only have to code for the following two device types
//   - Mobile (use mobile-first approach to using media queries or better if you know)
//   - Tablet/Desktop @media (min-width: 768px) { ... }

// - We are also looking for how comfortable you are using the code editor of your choice
// - Any other tools that you use to speed up your work.
